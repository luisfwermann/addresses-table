# Adresses Table

This project was done as a challenge for one of the companies that interviewed me in the late of 2020. The premise of the challenge is to read a very big text file of street addresses, show all of the addresses (in a single table) to the user and let it edit the content of the cells and also sort all the columns.

Unitary tests were done for the the components and services of the project (whom are in fact only one for each type).

The objective here is to show a little of my skills with Angular and the best practices of code in general.

## Commands
